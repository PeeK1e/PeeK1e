### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Platform/Infrastructure Engineer.

I mostly work on automations and tools to manage Infrastructure but also sometimes code some tools I deem usefull.
My favourite langs are Golang and Rust. 

Most of my Projects are on GitLab [https://gitlab.com/PeeK1e](https://gitlab.com/users/PeeK1e/projects) but also mirrored to GitHub.
